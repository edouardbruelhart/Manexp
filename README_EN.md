# Manexp

Manexp is a farm management application available for Android.

## Features

### Register Different Animals
The app allows users to register animals, linked via their ear tag.

### Record Diseases and Treatments Administered to Animals
The app provides tracking for diseases and treatments administered to the registered animals.

### Record Milk Production
A milking interface is available to record the milk production of different animals.

### View Statistics on Treatments and Production
An interface lets users view the recorded diseases for each animal. It also allows long-term monitoring of milk production for each animal. Additionally, a daily milk production report can be generated in PDF format.

### Take Photos of Animals
Each animal can be associated with multiple photographs.

### Keep Track of Animal Movements
A calendar and scheduler enable users to keep track of the movements of different groups of animals. An annual calendar in PDF format can also be generated for these movements, following the format provided by [AFAPI](https://www.afapi-fipo.ch/production-animale/sst).

### Maintain the Farm's Field Logbook
This feature is currently under development and is expected to be available in the next version of the app.

### Synchronization Across Multiple Devices
The app includes a synchronization system to keep data updated across different devices. This ensures up-to-date information is accessible across all devices used on the farm. The system is offline-friendly, allowing users to decide when to synchronize their data.
